# Online pet store
 
------------------------------

> - This online pet store UI was made using the react.js styled-components library
> - **Why use the styled-components library?**
>   - In case of large web applications, where we have multiple CSS files, the syntax begins to get clumsy and complex.
>   - Instead of using classes like we do in **CSS**, styled-components make use of components to define their own styles which can be reused easily across the etire project.
>   - They also use props for controlling the behavior of a component.
>   - Not only are all of these features highly user-friendly but also make the design of a react application far less complex and repetative.
>  Also by using styled-components keeping consistency accross various platforms becomes very easy since it gives *React native mobile support*.
